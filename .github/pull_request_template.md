3. Description:

- [x] Application is divided to logical modules / layers. Like working with api it's separate module, as well as working with UI rendering, or working with an application state, etc. Better discuss architecture with a mentor before implementing.
- [x] All the HTML-content is generated by JavaScript (body contains only one tag script inside).
- [ ] Application is SPA.
- [x] Webpack or another bundler should be used. There should be one HTML-file, JS-file, and one CSS-file (or it can be embedded right in the HTML-file).
