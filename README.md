# E-commerce Application

## Project Description

Welcome to our e-commerce application! This platform replicates the real shopping experience in a digital environment 🏪. It is a comprehensive online shopping portal that provides an interactive and seamless experience for users. From product search to checkout, the application ensures a smooth journey for the user, enhancing engagement and confidence in their purchases 🚀.

Users can browse a wide range of products 📚👗👟, view detailed descriptions, add their favorite items to the cart 🛒, and proceed to checkout 💳. It includes features such as user registration and login 📝🔐, product search 🔍, product categorization, and sorting to make the shopping process more streamlined and convenient.

An important aspect of our application is its responsiveness 📲, ensuring it looks great on various devices with a minimum resolution of 390 pixels. This feature makes the shopping experience enjoyable regardless of the device users prefer.

## Project Goal

The goal of this project is to create an interactive application that allows users to [describe the functionality of your application, e.g., "browse a list of tasks, add new tasks, and mark them as completed"]. This project also serves as a learning tool for exploring best practices in React and TypeScript development.

## Technology Stack

This project uses the following technologies:

- React: A library for building user interfaces.
- TypeScript: A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing.
- Vite: A modern build tool for fast application deployment.
- ESLint: A tool for code analysis and quality assurance.
- Prettier: A code formatting tool.
- Husky: A tool for managing Git hooks.
- Lint-staged: Allows running linters only on staged files during commits.
